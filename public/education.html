	 			<h4>About my education.</h4>
		 		<p>As a lot of folk here, or got here, I went to school for 18 years since I stepped in primary school. Shorter than what PhD folks got, but still quite some time. This page is purely about all the schools I had attended since senior high school, what I did there, what I had achieved, and what I had learned.</p>
		 		<p>Sometimes I joke that had been a professional student for so long, it is not easy not being a student any more. I mean that's the environment in which I had learned and adapted with its rule for 18 years. Then, all in a sudden, once I stepped out of the campus, it's no longer relevent. Rules are different in "real world". Some folks got lost, some folks felt hard adapting to new rules. Like it or not, it is a challenge. And nobody will ever tell you that. See, that's lesson one already. And no one will tell you anything directly about anything. Luckily, I adapted well and fast. Though I am still in survival mode, it's no bad so far.</p>
