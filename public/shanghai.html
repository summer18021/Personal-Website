	 			<h4>The Pearl of East</h4>
	 			<p>My hometown was a small 3rd tier city in China with only about over 3 million people. But here I come, Shanghai, a true megapolitan. Over 30 million people work, eat, sleep here every day. The economic center of China, the New York of asia! Excited, for both its magnificence and the reality that I got admitted into Tongji University, one of the best 32 universities in mainland China. But my excitement got beatten down by the humidity and high temperature. I was raised in an area where the air is bone dry. Like you pour a cup of water on the ground, seconds later, you can see nothing there, not even a trace. But here and now? Man! It was meesy!</p>
	 			<p>However I felt, liked it or not. My college years began. I started exploring myself, my mind I mean, in those years. I met some really great and smart people, and became good friends.</p>

	 		<p>Shanghai is huge. The population is equivalent to Canada. And it is really a developed place. In fact I think it is better than New York on most part. Everything is new, shiny, designed, or simply put, beautiful! And here I come, an ambitious kid from somewhere people heard only the name, and its famous beef-noodle and cigrette.</p>
	 		<p>My major back then was Applied Physics. A tough one as everyone could tell. My classmates are smart. I mean SMART! When I was informed about my admission, I was happy. I thought that though I spent most of my high school years having fun, bullshit around, or whatever, my one year of super hard-work plus over 4 month sleeping less than 4 hours everyday doing all the practices, mock exams, reviews had paid off. I thought I as smart. I ranked 3000 out of 300 thousand students taking National College Entrance Exam that year. I was one of the 1%. I know how to learn! But you know what? The first day in college I realized that I was ranked last in my class based on the score of the same national exam. I was the dummist, worst, known least student in my class. I was a nobody! That hurt! I thought that you nerds are no good. I am smart. I can be better than you in a few months! But then, I realized that was not the case. I realized that I did not know how to learn! I didn't have the approriate methodology for learning. These people spent years training, learning, not long the content to be tested, but the methodology of learning. Result? First two years of my college was hard. Math and physics was hard already, I need to learn how to learn at the same time!</p>
	 		<p>Those four years wwere sure hard. But life went on. I like the city you know. And to my surprise, I like the food there. The food around the region was more or less sweetened, contrary to where I came from where food were more or less spicy. And I loved it! I mean both! And ofcourse there are typically college bullshit you know. Like drink. Drink heavy with guys and gals for... no reason. Just because we wanted to. But not to the abuse level. And only at that time I know that get into a fight is a big deal. I saw people got locked up for 15 days just because of they got a bit fist fight! That was really to my surprise!</P>
	 		<p>As most people do, I lived in a dorm. Not to the standard of what you will find here in American colleges. It was more like an 80s army barack, but holding only 4 people. We had internet, which was and is a must. We had discounted mobile phone as well as mobile services, which was great. But there were really a lot of guys. I mean guys! In campus! It's a university! But the one I atended was a Science and Tech heavy university. And girls seems not like it that much. So, when you are around the academic buildings and it happened to be the time classes are over, you will be merged into a sea of guys. Yeah there are got girls, great girls. But there just isn't that many girls. Male to female students ration was like 2 to 1. You got the idea right? It was boring to some extent</p>
