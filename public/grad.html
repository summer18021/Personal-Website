	 			<h4>Engineer in Violet</h4>
	 			<p>I went to NYU-Poly for my masters' degree, which is my highest level of education received so far. Major, Computer Engineering. Why? First, it is about skills and knowledge. I like to make things. But to make things you need to know how, why, and how much. So, computer engineering. Why not CS? Well, you know most computer science courses are software heavy. But I think I'd better know something  more about hardware as well. Because what ever smart machine we would use, it is a computer. And a computer has at least two parts: software and hardware. So I thought it is not a bad idea knowing more about how the hardware works, design patterns, etc., so that I could have a deeper understanding of what I am working with. Is it a good a bad decision? I don't know. But I do know that I am as good as most CS grads on software, algorithm, data structure, and data base. And I am as good as most EE grads on hardware degisn, mathematical signal processing. And to my advantage, I have a Bechalor's Degree in Applied Physics. Thus I have very sound and good training on mathematics, statistics, logic, and materials. These are things not heavily trained in either EE or CS courses. In two years, I not long took my software and hardware courses, and some other interesting courses from some other major in different schools under NYU, I acquired my engineer's mindset, and my engineer's way of thinking as well as methodology.</p>
	 			<p>NYU-Poly used to be an independent technology school. But it had merged with NYU a few years ago. It locates in downtown Brooklyn. Not a very safe area, but the not so big campus is literally quite safe. It is a typical tech school you know. A lot of Chinese and Indian students. A lot of Chinese and Indian professors. Guys and gals are more or less nerdy and just mind their own businesses.</p>
	 			<p>Most days I could be found in Bobst. It is the main library of NYU sitting right next to the Washington Square Park. It is right in the middle of NYU's main campus. I love there. It was a 10 floor building with decent interior. Ventilation is great, really great. And there are students from other majors. Or say, they are the majority. So whenever I felt tired, or decided to take a little break, I don't have to watch a bunch of nerdy guys like me doing something essentially same as mine work with the same "Really? I forgot a semicoln!" face all the time.</p>
	 			<p>A great thing to be a NYU student is that it is a university perfectly merged with the city. And in a city as diverse and crazy as NYC, whenever, wherever you see a violet flag, you know you are safe and welcomed, like home. Students of NYU are generally smart, hardworking and insteresting. Talking deeply with people of different major but same intellectual level is always a good experience. Thanks to NYU, I became a New Yorker in two years. And thanks to Poly, I became an engineer in two years.</p>
